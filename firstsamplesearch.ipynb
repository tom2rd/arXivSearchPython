By analogy with the\\npseudopotential approach for electron-ion interactions, an effective\\nelectron-electron interaction is developed which closely reproduces the\\nscattering of the Coulomb interaction but is smooth and finite at zero\\nelectron-electron separation. The exact many-electron wave function for this\\nsmooth effective interaction has no cusp at zero electron-electron separation.\\nWe perform CI and quantum Monte Carlo calculations for He and Be atoms, both\\nwith the Coulomb electron-electron interaction and with the smooth effective\\nelectron-electron interaction. We find that convergence of the CI expansion of\\nthe wave function for the smooth electron-electron interaction is not\\nsignificantly improved compared with that for the divergent Coulomb interaction\\nfor energy differences on the order of 1 mHartree. This shows that, contrary to\\npopular belief, description of the electron-electron cusp is not a limiting\\nfactor, to within chemical accuracy, for CI calculations.\\n</summary>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>David Prendergast</name>\\n      <arxiv:affiliation xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">Department of Physics</arxiv:affiliation>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>M.
